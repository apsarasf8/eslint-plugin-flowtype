### `space-after-type-colon`

_The `--fix` option on the command line automatically fixes problems reported by this rule._

Enforces consistent spacing after the type annotation colon.

This rule takes one argument. If it is `'always'` then a problem is raised when there is no space after the type annotation colon. If it is `'never'` then a problem is raised when there is a space after the type annotation colon. The default value is `'always'`.
